# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    Making a website we are proud of. Also, we want to make sure to all put in equal amounts of work and communicate with one another to make sure we know our tasks and to make sure all our ideas and heard.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    Be respectful.
    Communicate proactively.
    Be responsible for assigned work.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    During lab sections, lunch after this class, zoom when we meet remotely, WhatsApp for messaging, meetings by appointment.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    By text and calling with zoom. Lucas also might meet with our client in-person.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    Client communicator (will be our main point of contact) - Lucas
    Project lead (submitting via submission form and overseeing communication) - Daniel
    Content organizer (making sure our content is properly organized and structured) - Angelina
    Meeting coordinator (coordinating times for us to meet in-person) - Julia

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    Transparent communication. We should all complete our work in a timely manner but if there is an issue, we can send a soft text reminding members that we need to all deliver our work in order for us to successfully complete this project as a team.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    Mediated conflict resolution. Address what the specific issue is and have a constructive conversation about how we can better solve the issue.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    Majority vote amendment. We will also make sure to keep our ground rules in mind at all tmes.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    Team bonding activities throughout the semester, and just having a fun time when we meet up to work on our project.

What else belongs in your team's contract?

Making sure we attend lab sections (and respective meet times outside of section) so we see each other frequently to discuss our project.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
